## Summary

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), considered as in vitro equivalent of the human epiblast, are a powerful model to study mechanisms underlying embryonic germ layer differentiation. We explore the impact of physical cues on hiPSC fate acquisition. By taking advantage of hiPSCs with reduced levels of the morphogen regulator, GLYPICAN4 (GPC4; line namely shGPC4) we have highlighted that differentiation of hiPSCs into Primitive streak (PS) like cells relies on an interplay between hiPSC morphology and perception of morphogens. Briefly, the shGPC4 line show altered ,morphological organization of the hiPSC epithelial sheet as highlighted by the presences of cell patches with abnormal tight junction formation and apical constriction processes. Through our cellular and molecular analyses, we have showed that disruption of the hiPSC epithelia integrity enhances competence of these cells to activate TGF-b signaling and to differentiate into PS. At present, we aim to understand whether epithelial integrity directly regulates gene expression in hiPSCs through RNA-sequencing analyses.

## Requested task

In order to understand whether the modification of the epithelium integrity, observed in shGPC4, primes hiPSCs for PS differentiation, we performed a bulk RNA-sequencing analysis of WT, shCTRL and shGPC4 hiPSCs (in triplicate each) at the undifferentiated stage. For this project, we need to analyze the raw data from this sequencing experiment. To this aim, the requested tasks are: 1) Clean the raw data, 2) Map the cleaned data on the human genome to obtain a list of expressed genes in each sample, 3) Compare the different samples to obtain a list of differentially expressed genes: WT/shCTRL, WT/shGPC4 and shCTRL/shGPC4.
